This version changes the default directory for color scheme fixes to the user directory. This will prevent some issues where Package Control would unavoidably erase the file during updates.

If you used the color fix feature before this release, your scheme has been removed and temporarily reverted to Monokai. You may need to re-set your global and syntax-specific color schemes manually; we apologize for this inconvenience.
